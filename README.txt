GAUSNET Hardware Monitor - Initial Upload:

NOTE:
The PHP page is hard-coded with how it displays the data for the system since one column in the DB could be one thing for one system type and something else entirely for another system type (for example, the GPU temperature column is used for CPU2 temperature on my dual CPU machines). The program also makes a lot of assumptions based on the hardware that I'm using (No dual AMD CPUs, no multiple GPUs, no Nvidia GPUs (that's the easiest problem to fix since it's just a copy and paste of existing code with a change from GpuAti to GpuNvidia assuming the system it's being run on only has only AMD cards or only Nvidia cards), won't work with Intel CPUs that have over 4 threads, no support for multiple hard drives, computers have to to added to the DB manually, the program has to be recompiled for every computer I run on it with the "computer id" variable changed, there's no installer and I had to manually add it to windows scheduler to launch on startup on every computer. Please don't assume that it's a ready made program that will just magically work for you on every possible hardware configuration without any effort. This was thrown together in a day and it probably shows. If you want to use it you'll at least have to do some changes to the web interface so it fits your system since it's all hard-coded. One day it'll detect hardware, work with many different hardware configurations, put the hardware configuration in the DB, and the PHP script with go through the DB row by row in a foreach, and automatically adjust the items and positioning of items on the black cards on the page depending on the computer's hardware that was pulled from the DB as opposed to having to hard-code a layout for every machine.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
You'll need a MySQL server and web server with PHP to make use of this program. It only works on Windows.
1. Import the CSV into your mySQL database, into a table called "stat". I reccomend using mySQL Workbench
2. You'll probably want to delete the existing records that only serve as an example and create a blank record with the ID 1. The name column is not referenced to anywhere outside of the DB and it's only there in case you forget which computer has which ID number
3. Then, go into the PHP script, put in your mySQL details, and customize the cards to your liking. Every machine needs it's own select row command and it's own card hard-coded in the PHP script. Use the cards I added into it as a reference to get started and work from there.
4. Open the console application is Visual Studio. I've only ever tested it with 2017 community. Open app.config and put in SQL details. The config variables are at line 15 and commented. Be sure to change computerID for every computer you run it on. (change to 1, compile, copy contents of debug folder to computer 1. Then change to 2, compile, copy contents of debug folder onto computer 2. (ConsoleApp1/bin/Debug, contains exe and dependencies))
5. I suggest creating a directory in Program Files and dragging/dropping the program in there. Start the program and make sure it works and all values display on the webpage as they should. Then, open Windows Task Scheduler.
6. On each computer, create a new task. Select "run whether user is logged in or not". Select "run with highest priviledges" I changed "configure for" to windows 10 but I don't think it matters. Go into the actions tab and click new -> start a program and point it to the program's executable. Go into the triggers tab and click new -> at startup. Click OK and reboot the computer. Go to webpage and check to see if it started up and everything works.

BUGS I ALREADY KNOW OF:
When using Windows task scheduler, there is not GPU data. Shouldn't matter for servers but does matter for workstations/rigs. I don't know why yet, maybe something to do with the GPU driver? Current workaround is just putting it in the startup folder on machines with a GPU.
The library I'm using can't yet read temp/clock data off my C6H/Ryzen machine. Can't really do anything other than wait for the library to be updated. It works on some other mobos, check with OpenHardwareMonitor first.
